The class contains:
■ Private data fields a, b, c, d, e, and f.
■ A constructor with the arguments for a, b, c, d, e, and f.
■ Six getter methods for a, b, c, d, e, and f.
■ A method named isSolvable() that returns true if ad - bc is not 0.
■ Methods getX() and getY() that return the solution for the equation.
Draw the UML diagram for the class and then implement the class. Write a test
program that prompts the user to enter a, b, c, d, e, and f and displays the result.
If ad - bc is 0, report that “The equation has no solution.”
